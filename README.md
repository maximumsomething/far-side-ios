  Find the farthest land from you in the world. Or find it for someone you know by placing your finger anywhere on the map. You can open up a Wikipedia page about that place, or google it from within the app.
  
  This version (1.1) will hopefully be available in the App Store in a few days from now; version 1.0 is currently available at the time of this writing. Here's a link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id941984119?mt=8
  
  You can find the Android counterpart at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nothingness.thefarside
  
  The working title was "The Other Side Of The World", so you may see that name appear occasionally.
